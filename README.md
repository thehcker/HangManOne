# Project 2 (HangMan part 1)
This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. 
In this exercise, the task was to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary.This file was downloaded and saved in the same directory with the Python code.It is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

<h3>What is SOWPODS</h3>
SOWPODS (currently known as Collins Scrabble Words) is a word list commonly used in word puzzles and games (like Scrabble for example).It is an anagram of the two acronyms OSPD (Official Scrabble Players Dictionary) and OSW (Official Scrabble Words), these being the original two official dictionaries used in various parts of the world at the time.

<strong>NB: Python random library was used for picking a random word.</strong>

The file has been saved in two formats(HTML and text format) and can therefore be read in either of the two formats in this project.
